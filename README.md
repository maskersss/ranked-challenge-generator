### Ranked Challenge Generator

The Ranked Challenge Generator is an ingenious Python program that brings a new level of excitement and variety to Minecraft Speedrunning. Designed for MCSR Ranked and adaptable for normal speedruns, this tool generates a unique set of challenges for every match, ensuring that each speedrun is a thrilling and distinctive experience.

### Dynamic and Diverse Challenges

With a meticulously curated list of challenges, each challenge is assigned a difficulty and weight. Through a random selection process based on challenge weights, the program intelligently assembles a set of challenges for each match. This process guarantees that the total difficulty of the challenges in every match is roughly balanced, creating a fair and competitive environment for all players.

### Fostering Strategy and Creativity

The challenges encompass a wide range of objectives, pushing players to explore different strategies, think on their feet, and adapt their gameplay. Whether it's finding rare structures, executing specific actions, or obtaining unique items, each challenge challenges players' skills and knowledge, fostering creativity and problem-solving abilities.

### Customizable Difficulty

The Minecraft Challenge Generator allows users to customize the difficulty level of their speedruns. By modifying the `min_difficulty` parameter, players can set the minimum difficulty threshold for a match, while the `ideal_difficulty` parameter determines the preferred level of challenge. This flexibility ensures that each speedrun is tailored to meet the player's desired difficulty, providing a personalized experience.

### Dynamic Thinking and Unique Speedruns

Beyond the thrill of competition, this program adds an element of surprise and strategic thinking to each speedrun. With a constantly evolving set of challenges, players must adapt their tactics, consider new approaches, and think critically in order to overcome the obstacles in their path. This aspect of dynamic thinking ensures that no two speedruns are ever the same, making each playthrough a captivating and thought-provoking journey.
